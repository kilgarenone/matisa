This is my attempt to bring the purest passive investing to the masses as envisioned by Jack Bogle and other 'bogleheads' thinkers as a consumer product.

As it turns out though, as of writing, this is a massive undertaking given the current circumstances in terms of bureaucracies and cross-border money transfer technology.

Anyway, I couldn't complete the whole user flow. But every detail in this repo so far was paintakingly researched and executed to the greatest extent of my capacity and intellect during this duration of time. This repo will serve for my future reference and hopefully yours too. :pray:

## Usage
The usual routine. `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm start`
